## Updating bkit Extension

### Via CLI (Recommended)

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/ww-w-ai/bkit-gemini.git
```

This reinstalls the extension with the latest version from the repository.

### Manual Update

```bash
cd ~/.gemini/extensions/bkit && git pull origin main
```

### Verify Update

```bash
# Check extension list
/extensions list

# Verify version
/bkit
```

### Development Mode

For local development, use the `link` command to avoid reinstalling after every change:

```bash
gemini extensions link /path/to/local/bkit-gemini
```

In Gemini CLI v0.28.2+, you can use the following command to refresh agents and skills without restarting:

```bash
/agents refresh
```

## Security & Permissions (v0.28.2+)

Gemini CLI v0.28.2 introduces strict security warnings for extensions using hooks. When installing or activating `bkit`, you may see warnings about tool interception.

**Why bkit uses hooks:**
- **PDCA Context**: To automatically track development phases and update `.pdca-status.json`.
- **Memory Management**: To persist agent-specific context across sessions.
- **Intent Detection**: To intelligently trigger the right agents based on your prompt.

These hooks are non-interactive, performance-optimized, and essential for the Context Engineering features of bkit.

| Gemini CLI | v0.29.0+ (forward-compatible with v0.33.x Task Tracker + Extension Policies) |
